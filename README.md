Handy code for arduino development

Seven Segment Display
----------------------
7 Segments Displays (Typical single numeric displays from alarmclocks) comes in handy when you need to show digits in a classic style,
but they do not know how to represent these symbols we call numbers.
This code makes it easier to control the behaviour of these displays with a shiftregistry and reduces the amount of data pins from your microcontroller. This is a copy/paste example and will in the future become a library with a simpler implementaion.

**Backlog:**
- Transform to library
- Linking with several ShiftRegisters for more Displays/Numbers.
- Add more animations

Rotary Encoder
--------------
To use a rotary encoder in your project, take a look at this example.
Dont forget to use a pin for the XOR Gate that supports AttachInterrupt!
